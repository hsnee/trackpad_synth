Trackpad synth
==============

Program to generate SKINI or MIDI data from a macbook trackpad.


Installation
------------

Choose either MIDI or SKINI output.  MIDI lets you choose from more
and better voices, SKINI lets you write new voices with the stanford
toolkit.


  MIDI
  ----

You need something that can turn midi into sound.  SimpleSynth is good:

Start it running.


  SKINI
  -----

Get a SKINI reader.  I've been using the Standford Synthesis Toolkit.
You can download it from:

  http://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/release/stk-4.4.2.tar.gz

Unzip it, run "./configure" and "make" in the stk directory.

Check that it's working:

  cat stk-4.4.2/projects/demo/scores/test.ski | stk-4.4.2/projects/demo/demo Clarinet -or -ip

You should hear something.

Put the stk folder paralell to our test.m and Makefile.


Once you have either MIDI or SKINI working, in this directory run either:

  # for midi
  make runmidi

  # for skini
  make runskini

Kill it with control C when you're done.  It puts midi on channel 3,
so that's the one you'd twiddle settings for.


Usage
-----

There are 4 rows (N_OCTAVES) each of which has a major scale (change
'scale') of 7 notes.  It gives polyphonic skini, but demo is
monophonic so you don't hear that.  I need to figure out a monophonic
skini reading program.



Misc
----

Started with multitouch code from:

For writing midi output I used the source of vmpk as a guide:
