Trackpad synth
==============

Program to generate SKINI data from a macbook trackpad.


Installation
------------

Get a SKINI reader.  I've been using the Standford Synthesis Toolkit.
You can download it from:

  http://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/release/stk-4.4.2.tar.gz

Unzip it, run "./configure" and "make" in the stk directory.

Check that it's working:

  cat stk-4.4.2/projects/demo/scores/test.ski | stk-4.4.2/projects/demo/demo Clarinet -or -ip

You should hear something.

Put the stk folder paralell to our test.m and Makefile.  Then you can
run "make run" and it should all work.

  $ ls
  stk-4.4.2/
  test.m
  Makefile
  $ make run
  gcc -F/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks -framework MultitouchSupport test.m -o test -std=c99
  ./test  D | stk-4.4.2/projects/demo/demo Clarinet -or -ip
  [now it should be accepting trackpad input]


Usage
-----

There are 4 rows (N_OCTAVES) each of which has a major scale (change
'scale') of 7 notes.  It gives polyphonic skini, but demo is
monophonic so you don't hear that.  I need to figure out a monophonic
skini reading program.



Misc
